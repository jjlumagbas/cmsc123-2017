Design some object-containment classes, and try out the Java built-in collection ArrayList 

1. [Create a UML diagram](http://asciiflow.com) for a class that refers to another class (object containment)
2. Create class definitions for these classes, including an `equals` method and `toString` method
3. In the [DrJava](http://drjava.sourceforge.net) interactions pane, practice creating objects from the classes you defined
4. Try out [ArrayList methods as per Java API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html)
