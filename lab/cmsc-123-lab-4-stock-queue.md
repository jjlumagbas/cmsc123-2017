# CMSC123 Lab 3: Stack and Queue

1. Implement a `Stack` class using the `LinkedList` class you implemented in the iterator lab exercise.
    * Implement the following methods:
        * push
        * pop
        * peek
        * isEmpty
        * size
2. Implement a `Queue` class using a circular array. It does not have to be generic, you can make it a Queue that only accepts integers.
    * The constructor should accept an int that will be the initial size of your array
    * The queue should be able to extend its size when it is full. The new array should be 2 times bigger.
    * Implement the following methods:
        * enqueue
        * dequeue
        * peek
        * isEmpty
        * size
